// The detection + guarded-reload half of the hydration recovery lives in an
// inline `beforeInteractive` script (see `app/layout.tsx`), NOT here. React
// reports #418/#419 hydration mismatches *during* the initial hydration pass —
// before any `useEffect` runs — so a listener registered from a React effect
// would miss the first (and often only) blank/corrupted viewer of the session.
// The early script installs a global `error` listener before hydration, does
// the guarded one-time `location.reload()`, and records the incident in
// sessionStorage.
//
// This component is the reporter: it reads that recorded incident once the page
// has hydrated and is stable (either after the reload completed, or on the same
// load when no reload was warranted) and sends the telemetry. Reporting from a
// stable page means the capture never races the reload that would otherwise
// cancel the in-flight request.
